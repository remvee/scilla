ExifMakerCanon seems to leak memory..


For version 1.0:
- examples: 
    - audio.jsp
        - use filter to dispatch requests and have nice urls
        - make list and stream types configurable
        - make seek work for itunes
    - get rid of usebean stuff in audio.jsp and imglist.jsp
    - put tld in META-INF
    - image and playlist; use info objects instead of beans
- InfoFactory
    - get method synchronization (profile performance!)
    - implement VideoInfo
- ImageInfo
    - add support for GIF comments and maybe other types (JPEG
      already implemented)
- org.scilla.info.AudioInfo
    - handle shn files
- org.scilla.converter.ExternalConverter.java
    - need new "can execute trick"
- JAIConverter
    - sync parameters with imagick so they will be interchangable.
      Maybe we want to define parameter sets as kind of interface?
- JMFConverter
    - implement it!

Future:
- define uniq operations for all operations
- pipes
- netpbm converters (needs pipes)
- sox converter (handy with lame and pipes)
- junit
- CacheManager
    - optional cache to database (blob) to allow keeping of last access time
	- has it's own jdbc-url to allow separate cache database
	- use temp file before inserting in database to allow
	  follow read
    - cleanup deamon (requires last access time record)
	- max cache size, lowmark, himark
	- per type configuration
	- expire request parameter
- gimp converter
- mmbase (http://www.mmbase.org) interface to replace mmbase's servdb
- texi2html converter (multipage output, hmm interesting)
- docbook converter (hmm)
